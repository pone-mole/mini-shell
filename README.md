<h1>Welcome to Trang Do's Mini-Shell</h1>

<h3>About this project</h3>
This project was worked on as part of an assignment for Northeastern University's classwork (for CS3650 Computer Systems).

The program poses as a demonstration of my understanding of some rudamental, but nevertheless essential, foundations of computer
systems, including but not limited to: computer processes, system calls, forking and piping commands.

Further instructions on how to use the program can be found in the *help.txt* file.

<h3>Credits</h3>
Instructions, examples and testing this Mini-Shell would not be possible without the assistance and adivice of Northeastern University's
instructor team. The coding is accomplished by Trang Do
